Due: 10/20/2017

Part 1:

	Design and Documentation:
		To build the PersonalInfo class, simple get and set methods were made for its variables: name, address, age and phone number. A default constructor and parameterized constructor were also made. See PersonalInfo.java for these methods.

Part 2:

	Design and Documentation:
		To build the Coin class, a constructor that set the only variable (which side of the coin is up), a get method to return that variable, a toss method, and a method that repeats and prints the result of that tossing 20 times in a row were all created. See Coin.java for these methods.
